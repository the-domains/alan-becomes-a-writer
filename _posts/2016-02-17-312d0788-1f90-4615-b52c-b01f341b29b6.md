Sometimes, the first few entries will be stupid. That's perfectly okay.

As I said earlier, the ultimate goal of this site is to be a mode of improvement. Through daily repetition, the mechanics of processing and arranging ideas becomes increasingly polished until it is nearly effortless. I suppose that some of this work can be interpreted as advice to aspiring writers. It's the advice that I've accumulated over a period of time thinking about writing that is then being put down on the page and broadcast for anyone to utilize. More than anything, I'm doing this to really remind myself of the concepts and solidify them in practice, but if they can benefit anyone else, then that's gravy.
